# web_task
Tango Code web challenge

To run, you need these dependencies: 
    - npm install, mongoose, react, react-dom, wepack, babel-core, babel-preset-es2015,babel-preset-react, babel-loader, node-mongo-seeds

Run: ‘nodemon’, ‘mongod’, ‘webpack -w’ simultaneously in 3 different terminal windows

Seed the database:  navigate to seeds folder, run ’seed’ command. If that fails, fill out car info at url localhost:3000/createcar (images are defaulted). If that doesn’t work…the video shows functionality!

Sizing down the window to 320 will trigger the mobile view
